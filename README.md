This repo contains examples of configuration files for Doc Holiday that:
1. Enable you to control which files from a GitHub repository should be indexed and made available
2. Optionally create a structured style guide (can be via public URL in the Admin UI) that the product will use to imbue generated documentation with a specific voice and structure.
